Y-E-S is an acronym with many meanings, from <span class="acronym">Young Exhausted Scholars</span> to <span class="acronym">Yodeling Experts Speeddating</span>, and a group of people with a background in music. We collect and publish scores on the shared platform y-e-s.org. For us, a score is by no means limited to the realm of music and could just as well be performance instructions, a recipe, code, choreography, a surprise file package, video games, film scripts, some poetry, or an online tutorial.<br><br>

We publish roughly every month and releases can be freely downloaded. From time to time we organize shows or festivals related to our publishing practice. Currently we are <a href="http://stellanveloce.de/" target="_blank">Stellan Veloce</a>, <a href="https://www.neohuelcker.de" target="_blank">Neo HÃ¼lcker</a>, <a href="http://martinhiendl.com/" target="_blank">Laure M. Hiendl</a>, <a href="https://andreasdzialocha.com" target="_blank">Andreas Dzialocha</a> and <a href="https://www.kajduncandavid.com/" target="_blank">Kaj Duncan David</a>.<br><br>
