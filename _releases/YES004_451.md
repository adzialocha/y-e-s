451 explores, among other things, an intuitive approach to music making, humbly taking as
inspiration the energy and approach to the guitar of improvisers such as Derek Bailey and
Fred Frith. The notation aims to give the performer a certain rhythmic freedom, in search of
an immediate and intuitive playing style, rather than one in which the performer is bound to
an exacting timecode. As such, any one wishing to play the piece is encouraged to be
creative with their interpretation.
