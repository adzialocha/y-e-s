The human body can easily bend its various limbs into 90-degree angles. Taking this as a basic premise, I wrote a “visual composition”, exploring the musicality of these movements as a live performance, combined together with different types of video as well as performance and voice. In this piece, 3 scales of body movement (hands, forearm, whole arm) are positioned in 3 levels of distance. They dialog with each other as polyphonically visual and compositional material.
