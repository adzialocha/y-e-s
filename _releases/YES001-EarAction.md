Ear action is an exploration of the space between listening and feeling. In the one-on-one performance a composition is played on ear-protection headphones worn by the listener. These headphones, which are normally used to attenuate environmental noises, function here as a sound box directly on the listener's ears. The headphones are played with various objects and the physical potential of sounds is made perceptible. Inspired by the sensory phenomenon "ASMR" (autonomous sensory meridian response), where soft sounds stimulate a pleasant tingling sensation on the skin, the two composer-performers Stellan Veloce and Neo Hülcker have developed their own practice of intimate ear play.
