 The Bucolic Treasure Hunt sparks from the need of the sardinian anti-militarist movement to keep organizing actions related to the RWM Bomb Factory in the village of Domusnovas without being interrupted by the police forces. The treasure hunt is a way for the Collettivo anonimo segreto caccia al tesoro agreste to be involved and somehow fight with a dark horrible issue in a way that can also be playful. It is important to be active and, at the same time, to get more people informed about what is happening in their backyard.
