To All Frequencies I Can Not Sense is a minimalist piece which deals with lingering spatiality - a meditation on the subtle frequencies which exist outside human perception, but nevertheless surround us, ever-present. Together, the performing musicians create a detailed timbral environment encompassing both complexity and simplicity, a contemplative evolution of dynamic sound-world that is characterised by a shifting emphasis between tones, chords and noise.
