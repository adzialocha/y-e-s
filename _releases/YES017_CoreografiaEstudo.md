"Coreografia estudo #1" is a study about structure, control and the architectural capacities of choreography. In this study, geometric drawings based on numerical patterns define the trajectories of four dancers. There is a minimum amount of elements in the score, which are repeated and recombined. It is through interruptions of the unison and through desyncronisation that different paths and new relationships emerge between the dancers. This short choreography is mechanical and labyrinthine. It is a calculation that becomes vertigo. An optical puzzle.
