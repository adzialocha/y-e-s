This is a performance for people moving through a space, wearing sonorous suits of discarded materials. Human windchimes are nature spirits, of a nature that includes what we usually overlook and discard. Trash, in reconstituted form, returns to haunt its past homes. The feeling is of an alien world overlaying the everyday environment. This world is composed of mundane objects, but maintains a separate sensibility and internal discipline. Human windchimes neither avoid public contact, nor court an audience reaction like a ball team mascot. They are on an epic journey to seek out the sounding potential of the space they are in. Their movements respond to particularities of the space they traverse. They inhabit the space and resonate its hidden music â€“ conversing with, but not bound by, its everyday use.
