A nap is form of polyphasic sleep: during the nap state, the mind is “fluid and hyper-associative”, giving rise to images that can express layers of memories and sensations. This experimental participatory intervention is inspired by the interest in unconsciousness processes: whats going on in the brain while we sleep, why naps are so powerful, how sleep improves our memory but perhaps including things we would rather forget and how we benefit from napping. Special Nap sceneries will be provided in Agora and different scores will take place including a nap protocol: nano-, micro,- coffee, extended, Dali, TV, Lucid Dream or Disco nap.
